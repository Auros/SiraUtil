# SiraUtil

SiraUtil is a powerful utility mod which expands the capabilities and provides more tools to Beat Saber modders.

## This is in my mods folder! Do I need it?

Probably! Many mods like ScoreSaber, Saber Factory, Custom Notes, and more depend on this mod for them to work, so don't uninstall it!

## Features

SiraUtil is a framework-like utility mod, but also brings some real features to the table.

### FPFC Toggling
By default, you are able to toggle in and out of FPFC with `G`. This is possible whether or not you use the game's `fpfc` argument &mdash; the argument simply tells SiraUtil whether or not to enable FPFC at startup. That keybind can be changed along with other settings in `UserData/SiraUtil.json`.

You can fully disable SiraUtil's FPFC by passing the `--no-sirautil-fpfc` launch argument. This will revert to the base game's FPFC behaviour.

### Song Control
By default, when in a song, you can press `Esc` to exit the song, `F2` to pause/un-pause, and `F4` to restart. These keybinds can be changed in `UserData/SiraUtil.json`.
